    subtitle: "I did my undergart at University of Toronto, but the cold weather drives me to pursue a master degree
    in a warmer place like London.\n    
    I enjoy traveling, as traveling gives me a chance to communicate cross culturally, 
    expand my knowledge about a new culture, \n and make me appreciate diversity, 
    which is something that makes our world fascinating. \n
    I have a stomach that fits Cantonese food. That's why I want to kickstart my career in HK! \n
    If you have anything in common, free feel to reach out to me!"
