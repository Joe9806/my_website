<h1>Self Introduction</h1>
<p>My name is <strong>Yuzhou (Joe) Li</strong>, and I’m 23 years old. I’m currently pursuing a MS degree in LBS.<img src="https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2017-10/london-business-school-Campus.jpg?itok=liDdbRa2" alt="London Business School" /> By joining LBS, I can make the most of the career service and the alumni network, which can help me land a decent job in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>Prior to that, I just graduated from <a href="https://rotmancommerce.utoronto.ca/">Rotman Commerce, University of Toronto</a> with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 / 4.0.<br />

<ul>
<li>Tiantu Capital (Consumer-focuesed PE based in Shenzhen, China)</li>
<li>Kredens Capital （Multi-strategy HF based in Singapore)</li>
<li>CICC (One of best nationalwide IB based in HK)</li>
</ul>
<p>During my spare time, I enjoy doing the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traveling (My favorite place is Cuba)</li>
<li>Gaming (Have been playing League of Legend for 7 years)</li>
<li>Tennis</li>
</ul>
<p>I am more than welcome to meet like-minded friends. Please feel free to contact me!</p>
