# Self Introduction# 
My name is **Yuzhou (Joe) Li**, and I'm 23 years old. I'm currently pursuing a MS degree in LBS.![London Business School](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/max_1300x1300/public/2017-10/london-business-school-Campus.jpg?itok=liDdbRa2) By joining LBS, I can make the most of the career service and the alumni network, which can help me land a decent job in the financial services industry.

Prior to that, I just graduated from [Rotman Commerce, University of Toronto](https://rotmancommerce.utoronto.ca/) with a cumulative GPA of 4.0 / 4.0.  \

Professionally, I have strong interest in TMT and consumer sectors, and have done several internships in APAC region:

-   Tiantu Capital (Consumer-focuesed PE based in Shenzhen, China)
-   Kredens Capital ï¼ˆMulti-strategy HF based in Singapore)
-   CICC (One of best nationalwide IB based in HK)


During my spare time, I enjoy doing the following things: 

-   Traveling (My favorite place is Cuba)
-   Gaming (Have been playing League of Legend for 7 years)
-   Tennis

I am more than welcome to meet like-minded friends. Please feel free to contact me!
